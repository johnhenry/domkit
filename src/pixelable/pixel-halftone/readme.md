# pixel-halftone

Turns the image into printed dots, like a newspaper photo: the image is divided into cells on a grid rotated by `angle`, and each cell becomes one dot, larger where the image is darker. With `ink="auto"`, each dot takes its cell's color. Use it as `halftone(…)` in a
[`<pixel-canvas>`](../pixel-canvas/readme.md)'s `effects`, or as this
element wrapped around the source. Part of [pixelable](../readme.md).

## Usage

```html
<script type="module" src="https://esm.sh/@johnhenry/domkit/pixelable/global.mjs"></script>

<pixel-canvas width="200" effects="halftone(5)">
  <img src="photo.jpg" alt="A photo" />
</pixel-canvas>

<!-- or, as an element -->
<pixel-canvas width="200">
  <pixel-halftone size="5" ink="auto">
    <img src="photo.jpg" alt="A photo" />
  </pixel-halftone>
</pixel-canvas>
```

## Notes

- Dot area follows darkness, so mid-gray covers about half the paper.
- Run `adjust(contrast …)` first for punchier dots.
